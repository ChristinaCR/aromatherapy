				<h2>The Fragrant Pharmacy</h2>
				<p>Essential oils are one of the great untapped resources of the world. Here we have a system of natural help that is far more than a system of medicine that can prevent illness and alleviate symptoms. These extremely complex precious liquids are extracted from very specific species of plant life and are in harmony with people and plants alike. By taking essential oils into our lives we find a way to provide our family and home with the protection and pleasure they need without polluting ourselves or our envionment with chemicals.</p>
	
				<h3>Medicines Out Of The Earth</h3>
				<p>There are about three hundred essential oils in general use today by professional practitioners, but the average household could fulfill all its likely needs with about ten; lavender, tea tree, peppermint, chamomile, eucalyptus, geranium, rosemary, thyme, lemon and clove. </p>
